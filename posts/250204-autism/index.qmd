## Hot Take
Recently, Donald Trump posted this (to his privately held social media company), Truth Social:
![Truth Social Austism Post](image1.png)

The intent is to bolster support for his Secretary of Health and Human Services pick, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

### Some context
RFK Jr. has a fairly predictable political pattern. As an environmental lawyer, Kennedy fought hard to keep waters 
clean and to move towards renewable energy. He fought against further development of pipelines, sued gas companies, 
and fought fracking.[^1] There is also a painted past for the Democractic party and quotes reflecting poorly of Donald
Trump's first presidency.[^2]

In 2015, RFK Jr. joined the [Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/), which he now chairs.
He uses his notariaty as a reputable environmental lawyer to push anti-vaccination agendas, to which he now claims
(in senate confirmation meetings) that he is not anti-vaccination (**fact**: second slide on the image roulette on 
Children's Health Defense displays promoting vaccine hesitant children's onesies, as of 4 Feb. 2025).

As the Secretary of HHS, this is already a matter of concern due to the enormous role that vaccines play in public
health. On top of this, RFK Jr. holds no credentials within healthcare or public health and is seemingly unaware or
ignorant of clinical or epidemiological facts. Without delving too far into whether he is the appropriate candidate
or not (*my take*: he's not and he's likely to be confirmed due to lack of congressional/senatorial backbone and 
manipulation by external forces), I'd like to look at the facts regarding autism, it's origins of false-links to
vaccination, and where Trump's numbers originate.
