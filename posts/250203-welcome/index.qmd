## Intent
I work with data all day. I have an excellent understanding of pulling meaning from various datasets and creating narrative that is true to story and keeps the context of the data at the forefront. I my intent is to share my knowledge, some datasets, and information in a more public manor.

## How this will work
My main goal is to keep this as open as possible: datasets, interpretations, assumptions. Hopefully what's shown will draw some interaction and things can be expanded on with new context or debated in a public forum (I opt for Bluesky). My background is within chemistry, engineering, and medical science but I will likely broaden the topics to tackle some issues facing humans.

## What to expect
Data analysis, inference, visualization, and opinions on various topics. These will be my opinions and will be subject to change. Sources will be provided whenever possible in order to maintain open and honest communication.

## Get in touch
If there's something of particular interest to you or something you'd like to see, reach out and let me know and I'll add it to the list.

## Special thanks
Thanks to all the [Quarto team members](https://quarto.org/about.html#project) that made this platform available. Additional shout outs to [MickaÃ«l Canouil](https://mickael.canouil.fr/) for some excellent examples and [James Balamuta](https://bsky.app/profile/coatless.bsky.social) for creating the Bluesky extension that makes the social interaction possible.
